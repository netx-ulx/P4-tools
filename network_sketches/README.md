This repository is meant to contain some of the widely known sketching algorithms which can be leveraged to perform several network monitoring tasks. Wherever possible the sketching algorithm is implemented in the data-plane in P4, yet some operations may still performed in the control plane.

Each subfolder contains the P4 code, the auxiliary scripts and the documentation related to a specific sketching algorithm.
